use  curl :

curl -X METHOD ekfjefsf

-Z send parallel request


-o / --output save to specified file

--create‐dirs
When used in conjunction with the -o, --output option, curl will
create  the  necessary local directory hierarchy as needed


--data 
Sends the specified data in a POST  request  to  the HTTP server,


-H, --header <header/@file>
(HTTP IMAP SMTP) Extra header to include in information
sent. When used within an HTTP request, it is added to the
regular request headers.

-F --form 

-G --get used wit h--data

-I --head 
 Fetch the headers only!

 --http1.1
Tells curl to use HTTP version 1.1

-k --insecure 

-4 -- ipv4

-6 -- ipv6



curl -X GET 
curl -X PUT 
curl -X POST
curl -X DELETE  


curl --upload-file uploadfile http://www.example.com/receive.cgi

 --connect‐timeout <fractional seconds>




http://host/file[1-200]:port
curl --resolve server_name:port:IP

--resolve
 Provide a custom address for a specific host and port
              pair. Using this, you can make the curl requests(s) use a
              specified address and prevent the otherwise normally
              resolved address to be used. Consider it a sort of
              /etc/hosts alternative provided on the command line. The
              port number should be the number used for the specific

xample:
               curl --resolve example.com:443:127.0.0.1 https://example.com



-X, --request <method>
              (HTTP) Specifies a custom request method to use when
              communicating with the HTTP server. The specified request
              method will be used instead of the method otherwise used
              (which defaults to GET). Read the HTTP 1.1 specification
              for details and explanations. Common additional HTTP
              requests include PUT and DELETE, but related technologies
              like WebDAV offers PROPFIND, COPY, MOVE and more.

              Normally you do not need this option. All sorts of GET,
              HEAD, POST and PUT requests are rather invoked by using
              dedicated command line options.

              This option only changes the actual word used in the HTTP
              request, it does not alter the way curl behaves. So for
              example if you want to make a proper HEAD request, using
              -X HEAD will not suffice. You need to use the -I, --head
              option.
